# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory will contain ADRs for significant architectural decisions made during the project.

## Current Status

No ADRs have been created yet.

## When to Create an ADR

According to CLAUDE.md, create an ADR when a decision meets ALL three criteria:

1. **Impact**: Long-term consequences (framework, data model, API, security, platform)
2. **Alternatives**: Multiple viable options were considered
3. **Scope**: Cross-cutting and influences system design

## Format

Use the command: `/sp.adr [decision-title]`

Or create manually following the ADR template in `.specify/templates/`
