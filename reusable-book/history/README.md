⚠️ **History tracking was not enabled from the project start.**

The first PHR was created on 2025-12-17 after user inquiry. Previous sessions were not recorded.

## PHR Naming Convention

PHRs follow this format:
```
{ID}-{slug}.{stage}.prompt.md
```

Example: `001-implement-rag-chatbot.tasks.prompt.md`

## Current PHRs

- **001**: RAG Chatbot Implementation (`/sp.implement` command)

## Future Tracking

All future prompts and significant interactions will be recorded in this directory according to the guidelines in `.claude/memory/constitution.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
