# Chapter 1: Introduction to the Unified Book Project

This book outlines a project to create a unified, AI-driven book using Docusaurus, Gemini CLI, and Spec-Kit Plus. The project integrates a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot to provide an interactive learning experience.

The core goal is to demonstrate a modern workflow for creating and maintaining documentation, where structured data (specs) drives the content generation, and an intelligent agent assists the user in understanding it.
